# GoogleCast
Implementation of the Google Cast protocol (for UWP only!).

This is a forked and modified version designed to work with earlier versions of Windows 10 (ie. Creators Update, version 1703) to support some older Windows Phones (donâ€™t ask!)

If you are targeting Fall Creators Update or above, please use the original version of the library which targets .NET Standard 2.0 and is available via NuGet.
